# Outwork
**by Curtis Yungen**

#### This version is obsolete. Check out Outwork 2.0 here: https://outwork-cjy.herokuapp.com.

August 2019  

Outwork is a website where two of my friends and I can log our running, biking, swimming, or lifting workouts, track metrics, and compete for awards. Currently, only these three users are allowed to have accounts on the site. However, the entire site is viewable in a read-only format via the Guest account.

Check it out by visiting https://outwork-1.herokuapp.com.

### Personal Reflection

#### Improvements from last project:
* I spent more time planning. However, project still evolved considerably during the coding process due to unforseen challenges and ideas.
* Utilized Bootstrap instead of media queries.

#### Improvements for future projects:
* Add descriptive comments to functions as I go instead of waiting until the end.
* Break up large files into smaller ones, namely App.js. 
* Improve algorithm efficiency. Site works well for three users but would scale poorly.
