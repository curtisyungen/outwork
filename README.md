### Personal Reflection

I tried to approach this project in a more organized way than I did Congo. This meant that I spent a couple days planning instead of jumping straight into coding. In this phase, I put together the Outline PPT file included in this repository. Nonetheless, I still found that the project evolved considerably along the way, as I discovered challenges, issues, and ideas that I had not forseen. 

One big improvement compared to Congo was my use of Bootstrap. This made the formatting and mobile responsiveness infinitely easier than having to create a bunch of media queries that adjusts each element individually. 

One thing I would do differently is I would comment my code better as I worked, because now that the project is essentially completed, I really don't want to have to go back through all my code and write informative comments about how it works or what does what. It would've been easier to do that as I worked rather than after everything is finished.

I also realize that a number of my functions are pretty...chunky, or inefficient. Lots of variables, API calls, bulky IF statements...I would like to improve on my knowledge and use of algorithms over my next projects so that I can write cleaner, more efficient code.

Nevertheless, it still works.
