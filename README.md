### Personal Reflection

#### Improvements from last project:
* I spent more time planning. However, project still evolved considerably during the coding process due to unforseen challenges and ideas.
* Utilized Bootstrap instead of media queries

#### Improvements for future projects:
* Add descriptive comments to functions as I go instead of waiting until the end
* Break up large files into smaller ones, namely App.js. 
* Improve algorithm efficiency. Works for three users but would scale poorly.
